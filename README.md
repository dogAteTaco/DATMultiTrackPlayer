# DAT Multi Track Player
Music player that enables you to play multiple audio tracks at once. My use case is reading books while listening to music and ambience tracks while reading but you may find another uses for it like using it for ambience in a D&D campaign.

# Features
- You can select a folder with your audio files
- You can add tracks to your current Multitrack from the scanned files and you can remove them from it too
- Tracks loop after they finish so you don't have to replay them manually
- Loads the Title of the track from the file
- Filtering to find your tracks by the title or tags
- You can add tags in the _library.json_ file to find your tracks more easily
